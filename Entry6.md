# A new language?
Personaly, whenever I am confronted with the task of learning a new programming language, it is usually a pretty daunting and involved task. This time though, I wasnt learning
a programming language someone else wrote, I had to learn one that I helped write. As a result, I had to adapt that process to this new set of challenges while completing assignment 2.

## First Steps
When learning a new programming language, the first thing I like to do is quickly look over the documentation so that I at least have a basic idea of how to format the programs.
I'll learn how to write a basic method, learn the format for calling methods, creating variables, etc. This time though, the process was different. Instead of reading documentation
to figure out how to write a program, I was able to establish the rules and formatting I needed for my program myself! In the case of Assignment 2, that process inovled manipulating
the interpreter so that it could interpret the head and tail functions on lists.

## Picking up the pace
Once I understand the basics of how the language, I need to learn how to structure my programs and write more advanced algorithms. To do that, I would normally look at examples of programs
written by others to figure it out. However, this time I didn't have any real examples as it was a language we were creating. My understanding of writing more complex programs in our new language
essentially came from lots of trial and error.
