# Building up the programming language
This week we got tasked with something really interesting, for assignment 3 we had to convert our already existing programs from assignment 2 to use this new structure/framework

## A puzzle of sorts
While the task itself seemed mundane, I was able to kind of treat it as a fun little puzzle in that I had to take each program and break it down at to a base level. Essentially I had to understand what each program was doing outside of the specific syntax and structure of the language.

## Break it down and build it back up
Once I had broken the programs down to their basic logic, I had to understand how to achieve the same functionality in the "new" language. To understand the structure and how to define my methods, I had to look to examples of using the language. This was provided, however it didn't have everything I needed, so I had to use those examples in conjunction with lots of trial and error.


## Wrapping it all up
After I understood the structure and syntax of this new language, writing the functions was surprisingly simple. Without even knowing it, I had done almost all the legwork with this assignment before even writing any code! Breaking the program down had given me a deeper understanding of what it was doing and as a result, writing it in the new language was as simple as expressing my already established logic and algorithm with different syntax!
