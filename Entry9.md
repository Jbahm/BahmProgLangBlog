# Invariants and Postconditions
Another topic I had a difficult time understanding initally was how to find Invariants and Postoconditions. Eventually through some practice though, I was able to develop a much clearer understanding of what they are and how to find. So with this blog post I intend to first explain the processes by which I came to understand the two concepts, and then will conculde with a quick summary of what I had learned!


## Putting it in a way I understand
In this course, one consistency between all the topics I have struggled to understand is the level of abstractness the topics are discussed in. The way I resolved this problem before was trying to put it in much more concrete terms, trying to apply these higher level/concept ideas to a real equation or problem. In particular, the one I did alot of practice with was Invariants. In the lecture notes, there were a few examples of analyzing invariants, however I was still not entirely confident in my knowledge of what exactly an invariant was or how to find it after completing them, so I tried to come up with a few of my own examples of while loops to see if I could answer those same questions provided and analyze any while loop I could come up with. 
I took a similar approach to learning how to come up with postconditions for programs, it was again simply a matter of coming up with these example mini programs and seeing what postconiditons they would require.

# Summing it all up
In my higher level computer science and math classes, dealing with abstract concepts has always been difficult for me. If I dont have real examples to apply things to, then it makes it so much harder to do. With invariants and postconditions however, they are very abstract concepts, but their very nature lent itself more to real examples then other topics. I was able to put the topics in more "real" terms, look at past programs I had written as well as come up with some new short ones, and then figure out the various conditions for them.
