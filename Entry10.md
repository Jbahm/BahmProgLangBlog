# What I learned in Programming Languages
Being that this is my last blog post of the semester, I thought I would use it as more of a retrospective. In this blog post I want discuss the things I learned this semseter that
I found particularly interesting, and why I found them so intriguing.


## Precedence Levels
One topic I found interesting this semseter was precendence levels within a Context Free Grammar. Particularly, building the different trees for possible ways to
interpret the grammar. I thought that part of it was super interesting because it felt like solving a puzzle of sorts. Finding all the possible ways it could be interpreted until
I was able to determine the one that would actually solve the problem and interpret my code correctly was a really involved process but it felt very rewarding to solve it.


## Reducing lambda expressions
Another topic I really enjoyed learning about was how to reduce lambda expressions. The reasons I enojyed learning about reducing lambda expressions were similar
to the reasons I enjoyed precedence levels. Reducing lambda expressions essentially felt like a similar puzzle to solve, it was constantly a question of "Ok can I further reduce this?".
Seeing the solution come together infront of me after making countles substitutions was also incredibly cool to see, and made the work feel really worth doing!

## Invariants
A third topic I really enjoyed learning about was Invariants because it was a really cool way of anaylzing systems. It was all about matching these different patterns between tested equations
to find exactly what was consistent between them. In turn, finding that lead me to the invariant for the specified system. Finding what factors between the equation guarenteed a consistent result
again was this really interesting logic puzzle that I had never been presented with before!


## Wrapping it up
I think the one consistency between all the topics I enjoyed in this class was the problem solving aspect they all shared. Reduction, Invariants and Precedence Levels all involved some sort of
logic puzzle, and that is the type of thing Ive enjoyed most in all my computer science classes.
